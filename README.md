## 🧠 What I Do

I'm a Computer Science student specializing in **backend web development** — focused on designing systems that are secure, maintainable, and built to last. My primary stack is the **Laravel ecosystem**, where I've developed production-style applications covering everything from database architecture to REST API design and real-time server-rendered interfaces.

I don't just write code that works — I write code that makes sense.

## 📚 Computer Science Foundation

Beyond the web stack, I have grounding in the concepts that make me a better engineer:

- **Data Structures** — understanding what's happening under the hood
- **Computer Networks** — knowing how data actually travels
- **Computer Architecture** — appreciating what runs beneath the OS
- **OOP with Java** — language-agnostic design thinking

---

## 🌱 Currently Focused On

- Designing **scalable Laravel application architectures**
- Deepening expertise in **secure authentication systems**
- Building **real-world, production-ready** web systems
- Leveling up in **backend system design** patterns

---

## 💬 Philosophy

> *"Backend development is about more than writing queries and routes — it's about designing systems that are trustworthy, maintainable, and built with intention."*

**Open to collaborations, internships, and backend-focused opportunities.**

*Let's build something solid.*
